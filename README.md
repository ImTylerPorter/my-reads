## Thoughts on the MyReads Project

This has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding projects I've ever done from a course. I've come into React with little to no understanding. Now I feel like I have a fighting chance to build out another simple project like this one!

If you have stumbled accross this repo, I highly recommend checking out this [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
